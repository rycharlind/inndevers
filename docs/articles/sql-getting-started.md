# Getting Started with SQL.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose language designed to manage data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is used to retrieve and manipulate data in databases.

In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of SQL and how to use it to interact with a database.

## Setting Up a Database

Before we can start using SQL, we need to set up a database. Here are the steps for setting up a database:

1. Install a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Examples include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

2. Once the RDBMS is installed, create a database and define the tables within it. This will be the structure of your database.

3. Populate your tables with data. You can use a GUI or SQL queries.

## Writing SQL Queries

Now that you have a database set up, you can start writing queries to interact with it. To write a query, you should use the following syntax:

```
SELECT [columns]
FROM [table]
WHERE [conditions]
``` 

The `SELECT` statement is used to query data from the database. The `FROM` statement specifies which table to query from. The `WHERE` clause allows you to specify conditions for the query.

## Working with Data

Now that you know the basics of writing SQL queries, let's look at some examples.

### Inserting Data

The `INSERT` statement is used to add new records to a table:

```
INSERT INTO [table] (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...)
```

### Updating Data

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table:

```
UPDATE [table]
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE [conditions]
```

### Deleting Data

The `DELETE` statement is used to delete records from a table:

```
DELETE FROM [table]
WHERE [conditions]
``` 

## Summary

SQL is a powerful language for managing data stored in relational databases. In this tutorial, we've learned the basics of SQL and how to use it to interact with a database. We've also looked at some examples of how to insert, update and delete data.
